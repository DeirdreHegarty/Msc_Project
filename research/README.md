A typical training procedure for a neural network is as follows:

* Define the neural network that has some learnable parameters (or weights)
* Iterate over a dataset of inputs
* Process input through the network
* Compute the loss (how far is the output from being correct)
* Propagate gradients back into the networkâ€™s parameters
* Update the weights of the network, typically using a simple update rule: weight = weight - learning_rate * gradient

*`torch.nn` only supports mini-batches, and not a single sample.  
If you have a single sample, just use `input.unsqueeze(0)` to add a fake batch dimension.*  

Loss Function : A loss function takes the (output, target) pair of inputs, and computes a value that estimates how far away the output is from the target.
